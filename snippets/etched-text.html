        Creates an effect where text appears to be "etched" or engraved into the background.

        - Use `text-shadow` to create a white shadow offset `0px` horizontally and `2px` vertically from the origin position.
        - The background must be darker than the shadow for the effect to work.
        - The text color should be slightly faded to make it look like it's engraved/carved out of the background.
