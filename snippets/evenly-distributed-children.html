        Evenly distributes child elements within a parent element.

        - Use `display: flex` to use the flexbox layout.
        - Use `justify-content: space-between` to evenly distributes child elements horizontally. The first item is positioned at the left edge, while the last item is positioned at the right edge.
        - Alternatively, you can use `justify-content: space-around` to distribute the children with space around them, rather than between them.
