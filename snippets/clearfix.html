        Ensures that an element self-clears its children.
        - Use the `:after` pseudo-element and apply `content: ''` to allow it to affect layout.
        - Use `clear: both` to make the element clear past both left and right floats.
        - For this technique to work properly, make sure there are no non-floating children in the container and that there are no tall floats before the clearfixed container but in the same formatting context (e.g. floated columns).
        - **Note:** This is only useful if you are using `float` to build layouts. Consider using a more modern approach, such as the flexbox or grid layout.
